# end-to-end-self-driving

a neural network that maps images to steering angles, inspired by Nvidia's model and open source software

# If you download this project it MAY run.

The dataset I was working with consisted of about 40,000 images and about the same number of steering angles in a text file.

To test whether the code worked I ran the program with a dataset of 4 images and their corresponding steering angles and the model ran successfully-that is, the model was succesfully
trained and saved(ie `model.fit(..)`, `model.save(..)`.

But, when I try to run the program with the 40,000 images I get the error`zsh: killed python3`.

You can find the dataset here:

# This code is not even version 1 but it may run as described above

# Thanks
